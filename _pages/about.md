Computer engineering student in Ecuador.

Escuela Politécnica Nacional.

Faculty of Systems Engineering.

Currently, I am pursuing a degree in Computer Science and am a fourth-semester Systems Engineering student. Passionate about technology and the potential of new inventions. Throughout my career, I have become increasingly interested in the fields of cybersecurity and networks, where I would like to specialize and contribute with innovative solutions.

In addition to my studies, I enjoy watching series, movies and I am a football enthusiast. My current focus is on strengthening my technical knowledge and learning about the latest trends in technology to prepare myself for the challenges that arise in the world of engineering.



**Skills:**

- Knowledge of platforms such as Emacs, Jupyter Notebook, Cisco Packet Tracer, MATLAB, among others.

- Knowledge of Java and Python at a basic-intermediate level.

- English level (intermediate-high)



**Certifications:**

- Basic computer hardware: Cisco

Development of an agent that plays on a 7x7 board, using decision algorithms to compete autonomously in a “Connect 4” type game.


This project involves developing an agent that autonomously plays a mnk-type game on a 7x7 board, with the goal of forming a line of four consecutive pieces (similar to the classic “Connect 4” or “3 in a row”). Using tree theory and decision-making algorithms, the agent must face simulated or real opponents with a performance comparable to that of a person.



**Project Features:**
====

- **Development language:** Matlab.

- **Implemented techniques:** Search and decision-making algorithms such as minimax and variants, as well as Monte Carlo trees and other optimization methods.

- **Evaluation:** The agent’s performance will be measured both in simulated games and in defense practice, where it must demonstrate its ability to compete against other agents.

- **Additional challenges:** The agent must comply with efficiency and accuracy restrictions to ensure that it plays intelligently, respecting the rules and response times.

The requirements are that it has to be 2 players, that one loses points and the other wins, and that it has to be played on time.
